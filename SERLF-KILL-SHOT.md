- **Paid models only when needed** (complexity-based escalation)
- **Result:** Each specialist costs ~$0.001-0.01/task average

## feedles.ca — No Meek Is Immune 🍽️

> Food insecurity touches everyone. The meek feed the meek.

### Revenue Flow
```
SERLF Revenue → 10% to feedles.ca fund
OSS Contributions → Community food mapping
Token Bank savings → Portion redirected to food banks
```

### feedles.ca Vision
- **Food bank finder** — locate nearest food assistance
- **Surplus food matching** — restaurants/groceries → shelters
- **Community gardens map** — grow your own, share the surplus
- **Meal planning for tight budgets** — AI-powered, nutrition-aware
- **Dignity-first design** — no shame, just help

---

## The Math (Why This Works)

### Cost to Serve (per user/mo)
- AI inference via The Clutch: **~$0.50** (free-first cascade)
- Infrastructure (shared AKS): **~$0.10** (amortized across users)
- Storage/bandwidth: **~$0.05**
- **Total cost per user: ~$0.65/mo**

### Revenue per user (average)
- $1 entry × 30% conversion to $5+ bundle = **~$3.50 avg**
- **Margin: ~80%** (at scale, 1000+ users)

### At Scale
| Users | Monthly Revenue | Cost | Margin | feedles.ca Fund |
|-------|----------------|------|--------|----------------|
| 100 | $350 | $65 | $285 | $35 |
| 1,000 | $3,500 | $650 | $2,850 | $350 |
| 10,000 | $35,000 | $6,500 | $28,500 | $3,500 |
| 50,000 | $175,000 | $32,500 | $142,500 | $17,500 |

### Why Competitors Can't Match
1. **They have employees.** We have specialists (AI agents).
2. **They have offices.** We have namespaces.
3. **They have overhead.** We have The Clutch.
4. **They charge for margin.** We charge for access.
5. **80% off their floor is STILL profitable for us** because our cost structure is fundamentally different.

## Novel Patterns

- **NP-L1-121: Kill Shot Pricing** — 80% off the cheapest competitor creates an unbeatable value proposition. Possible because AI agents have near-zero marginal cost vs. human-staffed competitors.
- **NP-L1-122: Specialist-as-Product** — The AI agent IS the product. No separation between service and server. The specialist lives inside the product it serves.
- **NP-L1-123: Revenue-to-Impact Pipeline** — Automatic % of revenue flows to social good (feedles.ca). Baked into the business model, not an afterthought.
- **NP-L1-124: Mall Pass Economics** — $1 floor eliminates friction. Bundle tiers create natural upsell. 90%+ savings vs. competitors makes the decision obvious.
- **NP-L1-125: Crew Cascade at Scale** — The Clutch model router applied to 15+ specialist agents. Free-first inference makes $1-5 products profitable at margins traditional SaaS can't touch.

**Total NPs: 125** (was 120, +5 new)
